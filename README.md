# davshell - Simple Shell to interact with (Card)DAV servers

This is a simple shell program to interact with a CardDAV server. It's main purpose is to serve as a simple demo client
for the [carddavclient library](https://github.com/mstilkerich/carddavclient) and a test utility during development of that library.

It currently provides little functionality interesting to an end user. The only thing noteworthy is that it supports cloning CardDAV addressbooks, to the same or a different server.
